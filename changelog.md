# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2023.01.08

- development on Bicycle in a Tornado has begun. I started with a game template from Crystal Bit [here](https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template)
- added the bike, with controls, and some logic to keep it on screen
- added pineapples aka objects, they are rigidbodies with an initial direction and torque to fly across the screen
- added a basic spawner to spawn in pineapples on a regular interval

## 2023.01.14

- it's been 6 days, and the game is complete and submitted. I totally forgot to update this changelog as I went along.
- the template has been AMAZING, and the build/deploy actions in github are super slick
- I over scoped by a bit, while still getting kinda close with what I wanted
  - I wanted more types of collectables and obstacles and a more sophisticated win/lose condition
- I think I can be more successful with a better plan, especially for what winning looks like
