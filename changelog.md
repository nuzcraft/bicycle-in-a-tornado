## 2023.01.08

- development on Bicycle in a Tornado has begun. I started with a game template from Crystal Bit [here](https://github.com/crystal-bit/godot-game-template)
- added the bike, with controls, and some logic to keep it on screen
- added pineapples aka objects, they are rigidbodies with an initial direction and torque to fly across the screen
- added a basic spawner to spawn in pineapples on a regular interval
